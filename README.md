This repository contains all the code and data written to help students make informed choices with regards where they want to pursue a Post Graduation outside of India. 

## Structure:

1. data : This folder consists of all the input files and data for the project. All `.txt` files here can be used and modified.

2.  src: Contains generic Python scripts which can be used for modelling.

3.  models: Contains trained model weights/serialized models

4.  notebooks: Contains all jupyter notebooks (i.e. any *.ipynb file) are stored in the notebooks folder. 

## Usage:
1. Use the notebook `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` for Exploratory Data Analysis and viewing results of analysis.
2. The `../data/NoFees.txt` contains a list of countries that provide free Post Graduation programmes for Indian Students.
3. The `../data/AIBest.txt` contains a list of countries that provide the best Post Graduation programmes for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

**These lists(`./data/*.txt`) are not complete and I encourage you to add information about countries that you know of to these lists that qualify the criteria of the list for the benefit of everyone!**

## Dataset
For the purposes of this repository, I am using [Cost of Living 2020 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/2020-cost-of-living?select=cost+of+living+2020.csv) to start off with, and am generating more features and metrics.
